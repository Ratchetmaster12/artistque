Artistque
=========
What is Artisque?
  -It is a basic Python (Turtle-based) Font Typewriter.
  
Will there be actual ANSCII font support?
=========================================
Yes there will be, but it will require A LOT OF TIME to create proper ANSCII fonts, however general fonts are supported.

Python?
=======
Yes, Python was chosen because it has natural turtles built-in. Also it's a language I haven't done some work in for a long time, so it's an old experience.
